				<li>Each player will take turns marking off lines.</li>
				<li>Each turn a player must mark off a group of one or more

						<li>A group of lines are lines that are next to each other-
							there cannot be an already marked off line in between them, they
							must be on the same row, and there cannot be an extra gap space
							in between the lines. See the below section on 'Example Moves'
							for further information</li>

			<h2>Controls</h2>

		<p>To mark off lines, simply drag the cursor over a group of lines
			to select them and then release the button to mark them off. As you
			drag the cursor, the lines that you are marking off will change color
			to gray to indicate that you have selected them for being marked off.
			If you an attempt to do an illegal move such as marking off no lines
			or lines in different groups, the interface will notify you and allow
			you to then attempt a valid move. Via the game controls you can also
			control various game options.</p>

			<h2>Interactive Tutorial</h2>
			<p>This tutorial will teach you the strategy for playing 'The
				Line Game' by exposing you to various scenarios. These scenarios
				will help you recognize 'trap scenarios', that is scenarios that are
				not winnable for your your opponent if you continue to make the
				correct moves. For our first example we have an obvious trap
				scenario in which the player who has the current turn will not be
				able to win the game.</p>
			<div id='TheLineGameInstructions.ex1'></div>


			<p>Given that the above scenario is one which you want to enforce
				your opponent into, what move would you do in the following
				scenario?</p>

			<div id='TheLineGameInstructions.ex2'></div>

			<p>Lets show another trap scenario.</p>
			<div id='TheLineGameInstructions.ex3'></div>

			<p>How would you win this case?:</p>
			<div id='TheLineGameInstructions.ex4'></div>

			<p>Finally, one last trap scenario to try out. With the '3,2,1',
				the player going second can either force their opponent into a
				scenario of '2,2' or '1' or '1,1,1' therefore guaranteeing a win.</p>
			<div id='TheLineGameInstructions.ex5'></div>
			<p>You have now seen several different trap scenarios, there are
				of course many more. With this knowledge you should be able to do
				well against the 'Intermediate' difficulty level. To defeat a higher
				difficulty level you will likely need knowledge of more trap
				scenarios. You can discover more of these trap scenarios on your own
				or also the 'Theory' section will also discuss more trap scenarios.

				This concludes our tutorial.</p>

		</section>
		<section id='Theory'>
			<h2>Theory</h2>
			<p>
				The goal is to put one's opponent in a position which they cannot
				win. One such scenario is when there are two groups of two lines
				left. We'll notate this as <a
					onclick="TheLineGameInstructions.loadCustomGameCustom('2,2')"
					href="#CustomPlay">'2,2'</a> and you can click on the notations in
				this section to load the specified scenario into the 'Custom Play'
				module. Lets observe a <a
					onclick="TheLineGameInstructions.loadCustomGameCustom('3,3')"
					href="#CustomPlay">'3,3'</a> scenario- this too turns out to be a
				trap scenario as the player going first will give their opponent the
				opportunity to force them into a <a
					onclick="TheLineGameInstructions.loadCustomGameCustom('2,2')"
					href="#CustomPlay">'2,2'</a> situation or a <a
					onclick="TheLineGameInstructions.loadCustomGameCustom('1,1,1')"
					href="#CustomPlay">'1,1,1'</a> or a <a
					onclick="TheLineGameInstructions.loadCustomGameCustom('1')"
					href="#CustomPlay">'1'</a> situation. <a
					onclick="TheLineGameInstructions.loadCustomGameCustom('4,4')"
					href="#CustomPlay">'4,4'</a> also turns out to be a trap scenario,
				any pair of numbers which the number is greater than 1, examples:
				([2,2],[3,3]etc..) are a trap scenario.
			</p>
			<p>Trap scenarios typically can be added to one another to create
				other trap scenarios, '3,2,1' is a trap scenario and so is '2,2'-
				and based on this building rule then so is '3,2,2,2,1' and so is
				'5,5,3,2,2,2,1' which is '3,2,2,2,1' plus '5,5'. The prior statement
				said typically, that is because combining '3,2,1' and '1,1,1' into
				'3,2,1,1,1,1' is not a trap scenario. Only trap scenarios which
				consist entirely of an odd number of ones('1' or '1,1,1' or
				'1,1,1,1,1' etc...) are non-addable. Then there is also an
				additional scenario which while not a trap scenario by itself-
				'1,1'- can be added to any trap scenario to make another trap
				scenario ('2,2' and '1,1' together as '2,2,1,1' is a trap scenario.)</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Here is a listing of some various scenarios:</p>

			<p>'The Line Game' is similar to certain other turn based
				strategy games such as checkers in that one is at an advantage or
				disadvantage based on whether or not it's one's turn and the
				position on the board- and this includes the start of the game. With
				the line game, scenarios such as 7,5,3,1 and 7,7,7,7 and the
				'extended' layout- the player going first is starting in a trap
				scenario and cannot win if their opponent makes the correct moves.</p>
